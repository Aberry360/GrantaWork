# GrantaWork

The following files were the subject of an internal collaborative project to provide customers with sample documentation for developing on the Granta MI API platform for python. 

As part of this work we identified major areas of interest for our customer base from surveys involving ongoing and potential implementations and put together a package of foundational scripts to help them get started.
